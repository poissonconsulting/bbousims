\title{Project population from BAS model by period}
\usage{
project_population_bas_period(population_init, birth, age, survival)
}
\arguments{
\item{population_init}{A vector of the initial population for each stage.}

\item{birth}{An array of the birth matrices (output of \code{\link[=matrix_birth_year]{matrix_birth_year()}}).}

\item{age}{An age process matrix (output of \link{matrix_age}).}

\item{survival}{An array of the survival matrices (output of \code{\link[=matrix_survival_period]{matrix_survival_period()}}).}
}
\value{
An array of the projected population with dimensions stage, period and year. Returned object does not include initial population.
}
\description{
Project population growth by period given initial population and survival, ageing, and birth subprocesses in that order.
Survival rates vary by year, period and stage; fecundity rates vary by year and stage; ageing process does not vary with time.
