\value{
A list of three tibbles.
The first named survival has columns year, month, starttotal, mortalitiescertain and mortalitiesuncertain.
The second named recruitment has columns year, month, cows, bulls, unknownadults, yearlings and calves.
And the final named abundance has columns year, month, sex, stage, abundance.
