\arguments{
\item{collared_adult_females}{A whole positive number of the number of collared adult females.
The number of collared adult females is 'topped up' each year at \code{month_collar}.}

\item{month_collar}{A whole number between 1 and 12 of the collaring month.}

\item{survival_adult_female_month_year}{A matrix of the female adult survival rates with dimensions month and year.}

\item{probability_uncertain_mortality}{A number between 0 and 1 of the probability of uncertain mortality.}

\item{probability_uncertain_survival}{A number between 0 and 1 of the probability of uncertain survival.}
}
\value{
A data.frame of the number of collared adult females, certain mortalities and uncertain mortalities in each year and month.
}
\description{
The number of collared adult females is 'topped up' at each \code{month_collar}.
Survival rates in each month/year determine the number of mortalities.
The probability of uncertain mortality determines the proportion of mortalities that are uncertain.
The probability of uncertain survival reduces the number of collared adult females without adding mortalities.
